/*Task 1: counterMaker()
  
  Study the code for counter1 and counter2, then answer the questions below.
  
  1. What is the difference between counter1 and counter2?
  counter1 is a function that has count declared within its function so counts scope is only available to access inside the function, whereas counter2 has count declared on the outside of the function.
  
  2. Which of the two uses a closure? How can you tell?
  counter 1 uses closure because the variable count is defined within the function making it only accessable within its function.
  
  3. In what scenario would the counter1 code be preferable? In what scenario would 
     counter2 be better?  Code 1 would be prefferable when you need many copies of something to act on its own. Like enimies in video games, it coule be essentially the same enemy but with different clothes but when you kill that enemy only that enemy dies. If you didnt use closure then killing one enemy maybe killing all the enemies which would equate to a boring game.

/* ‚öæÔ∏è‚öæÔ∏è‚öæÔ∏è Task 2: inning() ‚öæÔ∏è‚öæÔ∏è‚öæÔ∏è
Use the inning function below to do the following:
  1. Return a random whole number of points between 0 and 2 scored by one team in an inning
  
  For example: invoking inning() should return a numerical score value of 0, 1, or 2
  
NOTE: This will be a callback function for the tasks below

Use the finalScore function below to do the following:
  1. Receive the callback function `inning` that was created in Task 2 
  2. Receive a number of innings to be played
  3. After each inning, update the score of the home and away teams
  4. After the last inning, return an object containing the final (total) score of the innings played
  
  For example: invoking finalScore(inning, 9) might return this object:

/* ‚öæÔ∏è‚öæÔ∏è‚öæÔ∏è Task 5: scoreboard() ‚öæÔ∏è‚öæÔ∏è‚öæÔ∏è
Use the scoreboard function below to do the following:
  1. Receive the callback function `getInningScore` from Task 4
  2. Receive the callback function `inning` from Task 2
  3. Receive a number of innings to be played
  4. Return an array where each of it's index values equals a string stating the
  Home and Away team's scores for each inning.  Not the cummulative score.
  5. If there's a tie at the end of the innings, add this message containing the score to the end of the array:  "This game will require extra innings: Away 12 - Home 12"  (see tie example below)
     If there isn't a tie, add this message to the end of the array: "Final Score: Away 13 - Home 11"  (see no tie example below)
  
  NO TIE example: invoking scoreboard(getInningScore,inning, 9) might return 
  an array of strings like this:
[
  "Inning 1: Away 1 - Home 2", 
  "Inning 2: Away 2 - Home 1",
  "Inning 3: Away 0 - Home 2",

  "Inning 8: Away 2 - Home 2",
